# Week 10 Homework

Please find within the 'Week 10 Starter_Code' folder the completed homework task.

Unfortunately, I encountered technical difficulties when attempting to install the ARCH package required for the GARCH model in time series analysis. After following a stack overflow solution, my kernel would continually crash and my working environment was ruined. This required a reinstall of anaconda and the creation of a new environment. 

Consequently, out of fear of damaging my coding environment again and potentially causing further problems, the ARCH package wasn't installed and the GARCH models could not run on my machine. However, I am fairly certain that the code I have created is accurate and hope that this will be taken into consideration.
