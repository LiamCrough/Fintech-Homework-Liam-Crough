# Fintech-Python-Homework-Week-2

Find attached the Python week 2 homework assignment. 

As per the instructions it will generate a .txt file at the end of the process with the results obtained from the data.

The file has been exported to a .py format so it can be run on a terminal, conversely, the .ipynb file is also within the folder in case there are any problems or you wish to have a closer look at the code. 

I went about completing this homework assignment slightly differently to how we did it in class, utilising the functions from  pandas which I hope won't be a problem.

The only thing that I struggled with and would like feedback on is that I couldn't figure out how to round off my average change. Any variation of the .round() function that I tried didn't seem to work.

Hope you have had a good week and thanks for reading,

- Liam.
