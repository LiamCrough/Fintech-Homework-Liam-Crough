# Fintech-Python-Homework-Week-2
## 
PyBank Python activity has been completed and ipynb file is within the folder. 


As per the instructions it will generate a .txt file at the end of the process with the results obtained from the data.


I went about completing this homework assignment slightly differently to how we did it in class, utilising the functions from  pandas which I hope won't be a problem.


The only thing that I struggled with and would like feedback on is that I couldn't figure out how to round off my average change. Any variation of the .round() function that I tried didn't seem to work.


Hope you have had a good week and thanks for reading,

- Liam.
